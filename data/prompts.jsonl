{"id": 2, "prompt": "Sure! I have a snippet of Python code that I'm trying to debug, but I'm running into a few issues. Here\u2019s the code:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_average(numbers):\n    total = sum(numbers)\n    count = len(numbers)\n    average = total / count\n    return average\n\ndata = [10, 20, 30, '40', 50]\nresult = calculate_average(data)\nprint(\"The average is:\", result)\n```\n\nWhen I run this code, I get a `TypeError` because of the string '40' in the list. I want to modify the code to handle cases where the list might contain non-numeric values, so it skips those values and only calculates the average of the valid numbers. \n\nCould you help me fix this? I\u2019d also like to ensure that if there are no valid numbers left after filtering, the function should return `None` instead of raising an error.

I've been thinking about saving for retirement, and I'm trying to understand which option would be better for my financial situation. I know that both accounts offer tax advantages, but I'm a bit confused about how they work differently in terms of contributions, withdrawals, and tax implications. \n\nFor example, I heard that with a traditional IRA, you can deduct contributions from your taxable income, which sounds appealing, especially since I\u2019m currently in a higher tax bracket. However, I also want to know about the benefits of a Roth IRA, particularly regarding tax-free withdrawals in retirement. \n\nI\u2019m 30 years old, and I plan to continue working for at least the next 30 years, so I\u2019d like to know which option might give me better long-term benefits.
